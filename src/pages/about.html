                        <p class="leading-7">I am sure you know that on the February 24th the troops of the Russian Federation invaded the
                            territory of Ukraine under the
                            absurd pretext of denazification and demilitarization. Millions of Ukrainians are in the
                            epicenter of the war and humanitarian crisis.</p>
                        <p class="leading-7">Russian soldiers attack schools, kindergartens, hospitals and kill civilians. Because of the
                            war, millions of Ukrainians left Ukraine,
                            but there are still more than 30 million people inside the country, most of them need
                            help.</p>
                        <p class="leading-7">Now in the most affected areas of Ukraine there are shortages of food, problems with drinking
                            water and medicines.</p>
                        <p class="leading-7">You know that I am from Ukraine where still there are my close people. Therefore, I decided
                            to create a Fund for Assistance
                            to the Victims of the War in Ukraine - Peace In Ukraine.</p>
